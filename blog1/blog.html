<aside><em>FYI:</em></aside><h3>Game of the Week: <i>Hades</i></h3><aside>Hades is currently only avaliable from the Epic store, but the studio plans to move the game to Steam and other platforms once the game sees its full release.</aside><br>

<em>An early access title from our friends at Supergiant Games.</em> <br> 
<br>
<i>Hades</i> is not too far off from the beautifully drawn and designed games <i>Bastion</i> and <i>Transistor</i> from the same studio, but Hades attempts to jump farther into endless replay ability by using the rogue-lite system of progression that has become so popular in the last few years. The content currently in the game is top notch, but I am unsure there is enough here yet for it to be worth the money. I look forward to seeing what new content is coming, but would recommend waiting to buy until then.

    <h3><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>: The Perfect Example</h3>
<br>
    My standard of reviewing games is based on my love for Heart Machine's <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>. I consider that game to be a perfect 10, and various aspects of the game are what I compare other games to when considering each element. For example, the soundtrack, an electronic/ orchestral piano album from longtime composer Disasterpiece, not only perfectly captures the atmosphere and mood of each scene, but also is perfectly acceptable as a stand-alone work. Without that soundtrack, the game would simply not be the same, and that is what I consider necessary for a section to be given a perfect score.
